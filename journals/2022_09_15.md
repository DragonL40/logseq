	- Federated Learning enables mobile phones to **collaboratively** learn a **shared** prediction model while keeping all the training data on device, decoupling the ability to do machine learning from the need to store the data in the cloud.
	- **Benefits**
		- Smarter models
		- Lower latency
		- Less power consumption
		- In addition to providing an update to the shared model, the improved 
		  model on your phone can also be used **immediately**, powering experiences 
		  personalized by the way you use your phone.
