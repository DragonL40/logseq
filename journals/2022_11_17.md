	- **Research Problem**: [[Citation Recommendation]] #[[graph mining]]
		- Construct a graph based on existing citation of your paper (BFS fashion), with diminishing edge weights based on the distances away from your paper, then find a max-weight tree using $k$ nodes.
		- [RefSeeR](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/pubs/JCDL2014-refseer.pdf): deals with long queries, based on keyword matching, similar to a search engine.
			- Citation context -- not only the sentence where a citation is made but the sentence above and below it is also important.
			- **Global recommendation and local recommendation.**
				- global recommendation supervises local recommendation
			- Runtime: pseudo-polynomial
		- TheAdvisor: takes a partial list of bibliography as input query, uses citation graph information.
			- Sparse matrix computation $\implies$ high computational expense
	- **Research Problem**: QD Theory
	- **PhD application**
		- Importance of ...
			- EHR, Bachelor Thesis?
			- REU?
			- Fellowship?
			- Publication?
			- PhD Classes?
		- TCS vs. ACS?
		- How does professors think of students who are looking for research opportunity?
	- **CSCI-672**
		- CSCI-672 time commitment -- EE-510 depends on this.
