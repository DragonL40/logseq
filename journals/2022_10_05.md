- **Theorem**: INDEPENDENT SET is NP-Hard.
	- $IS \in NP$. Trivial proof.
	- IS is NP-Hard. That is, define a function $f$ which maps formulas $\Phi$ to instances $(G,k)$ of IS.
		- $\Phi$ has $n$ variables $x_1, \dots, x_n$ and $m$ clauses $c_1, \dots, c_n$.
		- In 3-SAT, decision is for each $c_j$ which liter is designated to satisfy $c_j$, we cannot simultaneously pick contradicting literals. In IS, decision is which nodes to pick; edges prevent us from picking pairs simultaneously.
		- For each clauses $c_j$, generate nodes for each literal. Add edges between literals that are negations of each other. To prevent picking multiple nodes corresponding to the same clause, also build a complete graph on nodes for any clause $c_j$. Finally, $k = m$.
		- Clearly poly-time
		- If $\Phi$ satisfiable, consider a satisfying assignment. Each clause has $\ge 1$ true literal. This means that we can pick corresponding nodes in $G$. At least $k$ nodes don't violate "clause edges", because we picked one per clause. No pair of conflicting literals is simultaneously true, so no violated conflict edges.
		- If $G$ has IS of size $\ge k$, then $\Phi$ is satisfiable. For each $v \in S$, set corresponding literals to true. This is valid because conflict edges prevent setting two opposite literals true. This is satisfying because we have $k$ nodes and at most one for each complete graph and no two nodes from same triangle.
