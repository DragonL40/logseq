- **Theorem**: INDEPENDENT SET is NP-Hard.
	- $IS \in NP$. Trivial proof.
	- IS is NP-Hard. That is, define a function $f$ which maps formulas $\Phi$ to instances $(G,k)$ of IS.
		- $\Phi$ has $n$ variables $x_1, \dots, x_n$ and $m$ clauses $c_1, \dots, c_n$.
		- In 3-SAT, decision is for each $c_j$ which liter is designated to satisfy $c_j$, we cannot simultaneously pick contradicting literals. In IS, decision is which nodes to pick; edges prevent us from picking pairs simultaneously.
