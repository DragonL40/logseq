- [[Edmonds-Karp]]
	- [[Ford-Fulkerson]] with shortest path in each iteration.
	- Why would this help us?
		- The shortest s-t path never gets shorter.
		- Between any two consecutive saturations of an edge ($f_{u,v} = c_e$ or $f_{u,v} = 0$), the length of the shortest s-t path strictly increases.
	- Every $2m+1$ iterations must contain iterations when the same edge $e$ had $f_e := c_e$ or $f_e := 0$ (because each iteration saturates at least one edge)
