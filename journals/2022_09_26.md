- [[Edmonds-Karp]]
	- [[Ford-Fulkerson]] with shortest path in each iteration.
	- **Lemma**: Let $P,Q$ be augmenting paths in iterations $i < j$, with the property that $Q$ pushes flow on some edge $e$ in the opposite direction of $P$, and for each iteration $i' \in (i,j)$, the flow path $P_{i'}$ in iteration $i'$ does not push flow opposite to either $P$ or $Q$ along any edge. Then, $|Q| > |P|$.
	- The shortest s-t path never gets shorter.
		- Consider $P_r, P_{r+1}$,
	- Between any two consecutive saturations of an edge ($f_{u,v} = c_e$ or $f_{u,v} = 0$), the length of the shortest s-t path strictly increases.
		- Every $2m+1$ iterations must contain iterations when the same edge $e$ had $f_e := c_e$ or $f_e := 0$ (because each iteration saturates at least one edge). Shortest path length can increase at most $n$ times $\implies O(nm)$ iterations $\implies O(nm^2)$ total. (strongly polynomial)
