	- [[Ford-Fulkerson]] with shortest path in each iteration.
	- **Lemma**: Let $P,Q$ be augmenting paths in iterations $i < j$, with the property that $Q$ pushes flow on some edge $e$ in the opposite direction of $P$, and for each iteration $i' \in (i,j)$, the flow path $P_{i'}$ in iteration $i'$ does not push flow opposite to either $P$ or $Q$ along any edge. Then, $|Q| > |P|$.
	- The shortest s-t path never gets shorter.
		- Consider $P_r, P_{r+1}$. Either $P_{r+1}$ was available to iteration $r$ (in which case $|P_r| \le | P_{r+1}|$) or $P_{r+1}$ must use at least one edge of $P_r$ in reverse (in which case $|P_r| < |P_{r+1}|$ by the lemma).
	- Between any two consecutive saturations of an edge ($f_{u,v} = c_e$ or $f_{u,v} = 0$), the length of the shortest s-t path strictly increases.
		- At some point $r'' \in (r, r')$, $e$ must have been used in the opposite direction.
		- Now redefine $\hat{r}, \hat{r'}$ as closest iterations $r \le \hat{r} \le \hat{r}' \le \hat{r}''$ such that $P_{\hat{r}}, P_{\hat{r}'}$ use some edge $e'$ in opposite directions. $\hat{r}, \hat{r}'$ exists becuase $r$,$r''$ are candidates.
		- Apply lemma.
	- **Consequence**: Every $2m+1$ iterations must contain iterations when the same edge $e$ had $f_e := c_e$ or $f_e := 0$ (because each iteration saturates at least one edge). Shortest path length can increase at most $n$ times $\implies O(nm)$ iterations $\implies O(nm^2)$ total. (strongly polynomial)
