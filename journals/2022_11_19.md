		- USC's computer science curriculum develops students into a well-rounded individual that has general knowledge in all sectors of computer science, such as artificial intelligence, software engineering, and algorithm design. This endows students like me with a comprehensive view of the vast field of computer science. The Honors Program will allow me to enrich my knowledge in research and help me find interesting problems to work on.
		- I took CSCI-675: Convex and Combinatorial Optimization last semester, which taught me more about analytical techniques in theoretical computer science.  I have also been working at the ICAROS lab doing research in quality diversity optimization. I hope that the knowledge that I learned in classes and my work in research can be used to advance the computer science research. I see the Honors Program as the perfect opportunity to do this. I will be able to enrich my knowledge in research, helping me find interesting problems to work on, and cumulate my findings in a Bachelor Thesis.
