- TODO Apply to W.V.T.
	- **What is your motivation for being in the Engineering Honors Program?** {{renderer :wordcountchar_rueoaie}}
		- Exposure to frontier problem in computer science, connection to fellow students with similar interest in research, experience in research through the bachelor thesis.
		- My classes lay out a solid foundation for me. I want to apply these knowledge to real world problem.
	- **How do you see the Honors Program benefiting you academically and professionally?** {{renderer :wordcountchar_keivmmkbl}}
		- CSCI-675 taught me continuous analytical techniques in theoretical computer science, and my work in quality diversity optimization at the ICAROS lab showed me how to apply discretization on continuous spaces. I want to combine them by applying CSCI-675 skills to solve the quality diversity problem.
	- **What are your long-term academic and/or professional goals after USC?** {{renderer :wordcountchar_edylqoase}}
		- My goals are to pursue a PhD in computer science and continue to work on my startup. My startup helps consumers without technical background access and utilize cutting-edge computer graphics technology. Thus, it is essential for me to be able to criticize and improve upon the state-of-the-art.
