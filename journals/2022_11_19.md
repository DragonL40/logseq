- TODO Apply to W.V.T.
	- **What is your motivation for being in the Engineering Honors Program?**
		- Exposure to frontier problem in computer science, connection to fellow students with similar interest in research, experience in research through the bachelor thesis.
		-
	- **How do you see the Honors Program benefiting you academically and professionally?** {{renderer :wordcount_tuljgjzh}}
		- I took CSCI-675: Convex and Combinatorial Optimization last semester, which taught me more about analytical techniques in theoretical computer science.  I have also been working at the ICAROS lab doing research in quality diversity optimization. I hope that the knowledge that I learned in classes and my work in research can be used to advance the computer science research. I see the Honors Program as the perfect opportunity to do this. I will be able to enrich my knowledge in research, helping me find interesting problems to work on, and cumulate my findings in a Bachelor Thesis.
		- This is also an opportunity for me to enrich my experience in support of my PhD application in the future.
		- Furthermore, I can use this as an opportunity to lay out an outline for my PhD research direction.
	- **What are your long-term academic and/or professional goals after USC?** {{renderer :wordcount_fxigtie}}
		- I have two goals to work towards after USC: (1) pursue a PhD in computer science and (2) continue to work on my startup. Both of these goals require me to be an outstanding researcher, as my startup builds product that is closely related to state-of-the-art computer graphics research. It is important for me to have good research skills to achieve my goals.
