- TODO Apply to W.V.T.
	- **What is your motivation for being in the Engineering Honors Program?**
		- Exposure to frontier problem in computer science, connection to fellow students with similar interest in research, experience in research through the bachelor thesis.
		-
	- **How do you see the Honors Program benefiting you academically and professionally?** {{renderer :wordcountchar_keivmmkbl}}
		- CSCI-675 taught me continuous analytical techniques in theoretical computer science, and my work in quality diversity optimization at the ICAROS lab showed me how to apply discretization on continuous spaces. I want to apply CSCI-675 skills to solve the problem of quality.
	- I see the Honors Program as the perfect opportunity to do this. I will be able to enrich my knowledge in research, helping me find interesting problems to work on, and cumulate my findings in a Bachelor Thesis.
	- **What are your long-term academic and/or professional goals after USC?** {{renderer :wordcountchar_edylqoase}}
		- I have two goals to work towards after USC: (1) pursue a PhD in computer science and (2) continue to work on my startup. Both of these goals require me to be an outstanding researcher. My startup builds product that brings state-of-the-art computer graphics research to the hands of amateurs. Thus, it is important for me to have good research skills to achieve my goals, and exercise the scientific method diligently.
		- After PhD, I want to work in industry research at tech companies. I want to use my expertise in computer science to improve people's life. Considering the ubiquitous of computers, I am confident that there will be a lot of open problems available for me to work on.
