	- Online RL: one must collect new experiences with the latest policy before updating.
	- Off-policy RL: an agent interacts with the environment and appends its new experiences to a replay buffer.
	- Offline RL: a policy $\pi_\beta$ is used to collect experiences that are stored in a static dataset. Then, we use that dataset to learn a policy $\pi_\mathrm{off}$ without further interactions with the environment.
