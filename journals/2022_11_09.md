- TODO Why does [[sep-CMA-ES]] outperforms [[CMA-ES]] on some non-separable problems? #Questions
- TODO Similarities between [[LM-MA-ES]] and LRMC.
- TODO Look into optimization with diversity constraint
- [[Constraint Programming]], effective methods to generate multiple solutions that are significantly diverse.
- What is [[quality diversity]] useful for?
	- Personnel scheduling (when not all user preferences are known in advance)
	- Routing problems (alternative paths are useful in case of unexpected events)
	- Configuration (a good quality product can be made using diverse sets of components)

- DONE Read [[Scalable CMA-MAE]]
