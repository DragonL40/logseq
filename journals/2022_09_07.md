- Matrix Multiplication #[[Dynamic Programming]]
	- Multiply $A_1, A_2, A_3, \dots, A_k$
	- $A_i \in \R^{n_i \times m_i}$
	- $n_{i+1} = m_i$ for all $i$
	- Do this with as few multiplications as possible, using that matrix multiplication is associative.
	- Key Observation: there is some last multiplication of
	  $$
	  (A_1 \cdots A_i)(A_{i+1} \cdots A_k)
	  $$
	  Before that multiplication, we will have computed
