- #[[Operating Systems]]
	- ## Synchronization
		- Use atomic (all or nothing) operations to ensure cooperation among threads and avoidance of [[race conditions]]

			- **Synchronization** helps maintain data consistency
			- **Mutual exclusions** help avoid [[race conditions]].
				- A shared resource is only accessed by one thread at a time.
			- **Critical Sections**: code vulnerable to a race condition
		- **Mutexes (Locks)**
			- Rules:
			  1. thread should lock before entering critical section
			  2. thread should unlock when leaving  critical section
			  3. thread should wait if critical section is locked
			- when one thread hols a lock, no other thread can hold it
			- only one thread can access shared state at a time.
