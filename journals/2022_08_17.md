	- Algorithm description:
		- 1. Initialize the HS Memory (HM), which consists of a certain number of randomly generated solutions to the optimization problems under consideration. For an $n$-dimension problem, an HM with the size of $N$ can be represented as follows:
		  $$
		  HM = 
		  \begin{bmatrix}
		  x_1^1 & x_2^1 & \dots & x_n^1 \\
		  x_1^2 & x_2^2 & \dots & x_n^2 \\
		  \vdots  & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
		  x_1^N & x_2^N & \dots & x_n^N \\
		  \end{bmatrix}
		  $$
		  2. Improvise a new solution $[x_1', x_2', \dots, x_n']$ from the HM. Using HMCR as the probability of selecting a componenet from the HM memebers
