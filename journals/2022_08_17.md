	- Initialize the HS Memory (HM), which consists of a certain number of randomly generated solutions to the optimization problems under consideration. For an $n$-dimension problem, an HM with the size of $N$ can be represented as follows:
	  $$
	  HM = 
	  \begin{bmatrix}
	  x_1^1, x_2^1, \dots, x_n^1 \\
	  x_1^2, x_2^2, \dots, x_n^2 \\
	  \end{bmatrix}
	  $$
