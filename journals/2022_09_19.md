	- [[Dynamic Programming]] is almost always same as finding the shortest path in a suitable graph on subproblems.
		- Table computation usually gives a [[Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)]]. Hence, no negative cycles. Most table computation are in retrospect optimized Bellman-Ford.
	- #[[Max-Flow / Min-Cut]]
		- Definition: An s-t flow is a mapping $f : E \to \R$ that describes for each edge how much flow is going through. A valid flow must satisfy the following properties
			- $f_e \ge 0\  \forall e$ (non-negativity)
			- $f_e \le c_e \ \forall e$ (capacity)
			- ${f^\mathrm{in}_e(v)} = f^\mathrm{out}_e(v) \ \forall v \ne s,t$
			- Value of a flow is denoted by $\delta(f) = f^\mathrm{out}_s$
		- Definition: An s-t cut is a partition $(S, \bar{S})$ with $s \in S$, $t \in \bar{S}$. Capacity or cost of $(S , \bar{S})$ is
		  $$
		  c(S, \bar{S}) = \sum_{u \in S, v \notin S} c_{(u,v)}
		  $$
		- Theorem (Ford-Fulkerson): Let $G = (V,E)$ be a graph with edge capacities $c_e \ge 0$, and $c_e \ge 0$, and $s,t$ a source and sink.
			- There is a poly-time algorithm computing a max s-t flow $f^*$ and minimum s-t cut $(S^*, \bar{S}^*)$.
			- $\delta(f^*) = c(S^*, \bar{S}^*)$
			- If all $c_e$ are integer, then $f^*_e$ are integer.
