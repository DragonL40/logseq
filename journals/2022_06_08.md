	- Using defaults in documentations? https://github.com/tox-dev/sphinx-autodoc-typehints/issues/234

	    /usr/local/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/pyribs/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/cluster/_kmeans.py:1316: FutureWarning: algorithm='full' is deprecated, it will be removed in 1.3. Using 'lloyd' instead.

	- `ribs.emitters._random_direction_emitter `
		- Elites are ranked based on their projection onto the random direction.
		- Passing in and out the same set of `solution` is kinda sus?
		- `self._batch_size` is set twice in `__init__()`
		- What does `selection_rule = 'mu' ('filter')` mean?
		- No documentation for `CMA-ES`?
	- `ribs.emitters._optimizing_emitter`
		- Elites are ranked based on their objective value.
		- Can we combine these two lines?
		  ```python
		  self._num_parents = (self.opt.batch_size // 2 if selection_rule == "mu" else None)
		  ...
		  num_parents = (new_sols if self._selection_rule == "filter" else self._num_parents)
		  ```
- TODO Read CMA-ES paper
