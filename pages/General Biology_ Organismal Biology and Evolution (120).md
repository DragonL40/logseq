- What is [[science]]?
	- Science is a way of knowingâ€”an approach to understand- ing the natural world.
- How to differentiate science from pseudoscience?
- What is the [[Scientific Method]]?
- [[Experimentation]]
- [[Observation]]
- What is [[hypothesis testing]]?
- What is a proper [[scientific hypothesis]]?
  collapsed:: true
	- proposed explanation for a scientific question
	- must be **testable**; more specifically it should be **falsifiable**
	- Other scientists should be able to **reproduce** the results by following the same procedure
- What can the results of an experiment do to its hypothesis?
  collapsed:: true
	- It can either **support** or **falsify** the explanation.
- What are [[Independent Variable]], [[Dependent Variable]], and [[Controlled Variable]]?
- What is the [[Null Hypothesis]] method for [[hypothesis testing]] ?
  collapsed:: true
	-
	  > Minimize the probability of rejecting the null, if the null is true.
- What is the difference between **facts** and **hypothesis** in [[science]]?
- What is the relation between a [[scientific theory]] and hypotheses?
- [[ Theory of Evolution]]
- What is [[pseudoscience]]?
  collapsed:: true
	- Not testable or reproducible OR already falsified.
- What is life ([[living organisms]])?
- Is [[bacteria]] (sing. bacterium) an organism?
- Is [[viruses]] an organism?
- What makes up an individual living organism?
  collapsed:: true
	- The [[cell]] is the smallest unit of organization that can perform all activities required for life
- Two main types of [[cell]]?
  collapsed:: true
	- [[Eukaryotic Cell]]
	- [[Prokaryotic Cell]]
- What is blending?
  collapsed:: true
	- the idea that genetic material contributed by the two parents mixes in a manner analogous to the way blue and yellow paints blend to make green
- What is particulate?
  collapsed:: true
	- parents pass on discrete heritable units (genes) that retain their separate identities in offspring; i.e., more like a deck of cards than a pail of paint
- Who tested the hypothesis about blending and particulate?
	- [[Gregor Mendel]]
- What is [[Mendel's Model]] of inheritance?
  collapsed:: true

- Difference between [[Genotype]] and [[Phenotype]]?
- What is difference between [[Homozygous]] and [[Heterozygous]]?
- What is [[DNA]]?
- What is [[RNA]]?
- What is the difference between [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]?
- What are [[chromosomes]]?
- What are [[genes]]?
- What is the locus?
- How do genes code for characteristics?
- Genes code for proteins
	- Polymers of amino acids = polypeptides
- What are [[proteins]]?
	- proteins are constructed from amino acids.
	- nearly every dynamic function of a living being depends on proteins
- How is mRNA translated into amino acids?
- What is mRNA?
- What is tRNA?
- What is codominance?
  collapsed:: true
	-
	  $$I^AI^A \times I^BI^B = I^AI^B$$
	- type A $\times$ type B = type AB
- What is incomplete dominance?
  collapsed:: true
	-
	  $$C^RC^R \times C^BC^B = C^RC^B$$
	- red $\times$ blue = purple
- What about a cross involving multiple characters?
	-
