## Introduction to Genetics
- What is blending inheritance and what is particulate inheritance?
  collapsed:: true
	- Blending: the idea that genetic material contributed by the two parents mixes in a manner analogous to the way blue and yellow paints blend to make green
	- Particulate: parents pass on discrete heritable units (genes) that retain their separate identities in offspring; i.e., more like a deck of cards than a pail of paint
- How did [[Gregor Mendel]] test the hypothesis regarding blending and particulate inheritance?
  collapsed:: true
	- Reproduction and hybridization experiments with garden pea plant
	- Why peas?
	  collapsed:: true
		- Many distinct traits
		- Easy to do both [[cross-fertilization]] and [[self-fertilization]]
		- Fairly short generation time
	- Mendel tracked inheritance of characters with two discrete forms
	- Started with varieties of pea plants that had only always produced the same variety via self-pollination ([[true-breeding]]).
	- ((61447279-baef-47b3-984b-5af6ffd161e8))
- What is [[Mendel's Model]] of inheritance? #numlist
  collapsed:: true
	- Trait variation is due to alternative variations (alleles) of "heritable factors" (genes)
	- For each character an organism inherits two alleles, one from each parent
	- **Dominant** alleles mask **recessive** alleles

- How do genes code for characteristics?
  collapsed:: true
	- Most genes are a “recipe” for the production of protein
	- Genes on DNA are **transcribed** to mRNA, which is then **translated** to protein through the use of tRNA (mRNA = messenger RNA; tRNA = transfer RNA)
	- Essentially, genes code for proteins = polymers of amino acids = polypeptides constructed from 20 amino acids.

	- Mendel already knew that yellow and round were dominant traits
	- ((6144d4d1-ade9-4a75-9ab4-b61c4513e140))
	- This is called the [[law of independent assortment]], which is true only because these genes are on different chromosomes.
	- Conversely; [[linked genes]] on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together (**the number always deviate somewhat due to cross over recombination**).
- What is [[mitosis]]?

	- Observation 1. **Populations show heritable variation**
	- Observation 2. **All species have the potential for exponential growth. But the environment usually cannot support this; many individuals fail to reproduce.**

## Sexual Reproduction and Sexual Selection
- ![Lecture_09.pdf](../assets/Lecture_09_1631840407334_0.pdf)
- Microorganism typically reproduce through simple mitosis, some [[asexual reproduction]] (multicellular) happens by [[budding]], offspring are clones of its parents.
- How do we define biological sex?
  collapsed:: true
	- In biology, defined by having gonads that can produce **eggs** or **sperm**.
	- In mammals, males always have XY chromosomes, while females have XX.
	- There is an enormous amount of variation in other animals and plants (e.g. birds: females XY; crocodiles: temperature, not chromosomes)
- Inheritance of [[sex-linked gene]]
  collapsed:: true
	- The mammalian sex chromosomes have genes for many characters unrelated to sex (e.g. color blindness vs normal color vision)
	- A gene located on either sex chromosome is called a [[sex-linked gene]] (sex-linked genes follow specific patterns of inheritance)
- Why is [[sexual reproduction]] **expensive**?
  collapsed:: true
	- You have to find a mate, sometimes facing competition.
	- Assess mate potential: both sexes have to show signs of sexual maturity and fertility.
- So why [[sexual reproduction]]?
  collapsed:: true
	- Increase genetic variation among offspring
- What is [[Sexual Selection]]?
  collapsed:: true
	- {{embed [[sexual selection]]}}
