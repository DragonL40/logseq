- Processors have hardware to help track areas of memory used by a program & verify appropriate address usage
- When performing a memory access the processor will indicate the desired operation:
	- Fetch (Execute), Read data, Write data
- This will be compared to the access permissions stored in the MMU and catch any violation
	- The stack area can be set for **N**o-e**X**ecute (**NX** or **X=0**)
	- **If the processor sees an attempt to execute code from the stack it will halt the program**
