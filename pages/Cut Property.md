- Let $S$ be a set of nodes s.t. $\phi \subset S \subset V$.
- Let $e$ be the minimum cost edge with one end in $S$ and one end in $V - S$.
- $e$ is in every [[Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)]] of $G$.
- #[[Proof by Contradiction]]
	- Let $S$ and $e = <u,v>$ be s.t. $u \in S$, $v \in V-S$, and $e$ is the min-cost edge crossing $(S, V-S)$
	- Let $T^*$ be an [[Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)]] of $G$, and assume for contradiction that $e \notin T^*$
	- There is a path $P$ from $u$ to $v$ in $T^*$
	- Let $e^* = (u^*, v^*)$ be the first edge in $P$ crossing from $S$ to $S-V$
	- By definition, $C_{e^*} > C_e$
	- Therefore, we can exchange $e^*$ for $e$ to get $T' = T^* - e^* + e$
	- $T'$ must be a MST because
		- $|T^*| = n-1$
		- $(V, T')$ is connected
		- ((613fd6c8-6437-42e4-9e61-9aba48332d96)) implies that $T'$ is a spanning tree of $G$.
	- Contradiction: $C(T') = C(T^*) - C_{e^*} + C_e < C(T^*)$
