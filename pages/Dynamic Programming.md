- **Dynamic Programming** is the process of transforming a recursive function which replicates work, into an iterative one.
	- The iterative solution will solve each subproblem once and write down the answer for future reference.
- Arriving at a dynamic programming solution begins by writing a recursive function.
	- This is the hardest part, and ironically, the dynamic programming part is significantly easier.
	- It's not that dynamic programming is hard. [[Recursion]] is hard.
