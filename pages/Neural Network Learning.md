- **Feedforward network** has connections only in one direction - [[Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)]] with designated input and output nodes.
- Each node computes a function of its inputs and passes the result to its successors in the network.
- **Recurrent network** feeds its intermediate of final outputs back into its own inputs.
	- The signal values within the network form a dynamical system that has internal state or memory.
- [[universal approximation theorem]] states that a network with just two layers of computational units, the first nonlinear and the second linear, can approximate any continuous function to an arbitrary degree of accuracy.
