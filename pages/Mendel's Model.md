- Trait variation is due to alternative variations (alleles) of "heritable factors" (genes)
- For each character an organism inherits two alleles, one from each parent
- Dominant alleles mask recessive alleles
- Two alleles for a heritable character segregate during gamete formation and end up in different gametes ([[Law of Segregation]])
