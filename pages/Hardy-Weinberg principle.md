- Allele frequencies and genotype frequencies in a population will not change between generations, and genotype frequencies follow a set pattern.
- The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium #numlist
	- No [[mutation]]
	- No [[gene flow]]
	- No [[natural selection]]
	- Random mating
	- Large population
- The Hardy-Weinberg Equation:
	-
	  $$p + q = 1$$
	- $p =$ frequency of the dominant **allele** in the population
	- $q =$ frequency of the recessive **allele** in the population
	-
	  $$p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$$
	- $p^2 =$ frequency of homozygous dominant **individuals** (genotypes)
	- $q^2 =$ frequency of homozygous recessive **individuals** (genotypes)
	- $2pq =$ frequency of heterozygous **individuals** (genotypes)
