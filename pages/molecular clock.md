- Some parts of the genome will accumulate {{cloze changes (mutations)}} at a {{cloze relatively steady}} rate
- The {{cloze speed of accumulation}} depends on the part of DNA under study (some fast, some slow)
- The "clock" is calibrated using the {{cloze fossil record}} (e.g. {{cloze orangutan fossils}} have been securely dated for apes), or the accumulation of {{cloze mutations}} over generations
- Example: orangutan split
	- ((615a541a-64ed-4266-a772-352dfde3b88e))
	- By using the {{cloze known age}} of the orangutan split, plus info on orangutan DNA, we know the rate of mutations in certain parts of the ape genome.
	- Count known differences in DNA between humans and chimps
