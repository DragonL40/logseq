- Some parts of the genome will accumulate {{cloze changes (mutations)}} at a {{cloze relatively steady}} rate
- The {{cloze speed of accumulation}} depends on the part of DNA under study (some fast, some slow)
- The "clock" is calibrated using the {{cloze fossil record}} (e.g. {{cloze orangutan fossils}} have been securely dated for apes), or the accumulation of {{cloze mutations}} over generations
- Example: orangutan split
	- ((615a541a-64ed-4266-a772-352dfde3b88e))
	- By using the {{cloze known age}} of the orangutan split, plus info on {{cloze orangutan DNA}}, we know the {{cloze rate of mutations}} in certain parts of the ape genome.
	- Count {{cloze known differences in DNA}} between humans and chimps
	- The data indicates a date of the split between {{cloze Pan and Homo}} at about 6-8 mya.
