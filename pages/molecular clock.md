- Some parts of the genome will accumulate {{cloze changes (mutations)}} at a {{cloze relatively steady}} relatively steady rate
- The speed of accumulation depends on the part of DNA under study (some fast, some slow)
- The "clock" is calibrated using the fossil record (e.g. orangutan fossils have been securely dated for apes), or the accumulation of mutations over generations
