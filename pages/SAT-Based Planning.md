- **Translate classical planning problems into satisfiability problems, and solving them using a highly optimized SAT solver.**
- Instantiate all predicates and eliminate those that are in all states reachable from the start state by operator applications.
- Instantiate all operator schemata and eliminate those operators whose preconditions are not satisfied in any state reachable from the start state.
- Convert the remaining ground(ed) predicates and operators for each time slice $1...T$ (for a given time horizon $T$) into propositional symbols.
