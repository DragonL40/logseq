- **Translate classical planning problems into satisfiability problems, and solving them using a highly optimized SAT solver.**
-
- Instantiate all predicates and eliminate those that are in all states reachable from the start state by operator applications.
- Instantiate all operator schemata and eliminate those operators whose preconditions are not satisfied in any state reachable from the start state.
