- ```
  - Treat it more like a poster - if the recruiter had 6 seconds to look at your
    resume, what would they see?
  - That means you need to be able to skim and see the important things, so:
    - Things that are important should be on the left
    - Things that are even more important should be bolded
  - About bullets
    - Don't use bullets for top level things (i.e. decrease indent of everything
      by 1)
    - Keep bullets short - 1 line - multi-line bullets defy the point of bullets
      here
    - Start the bullet with the important things you did; remember, important
      things on the left
    - Try to only have 3 bullets for each item - 4 is stretching it
      - Cut down to 1-2 if you have a lot of experiences
  - Keep it skimmable by decreasing text as much as possible
    - Don't overwhelm the reader with text
    - Use whitespace appropriately
    - See note on reducing number of bullets
  - Never use first-person - at least in the US
  - Use smaller margins to fit more stuff
