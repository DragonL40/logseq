- The multi-armed bandit problem is a classic reinforcement learning example where we are given a slot machine with $n$ arms (bandits) with each arm having its own *rigged* probability distribution of success. Pulling any one of the arms gives you a stochastic reward of either $R=1$ for success, or $R=0$ for failure. Our objective is to pull the arms one-by-one in sequence such that we maximize our total reward collected in the long run.
