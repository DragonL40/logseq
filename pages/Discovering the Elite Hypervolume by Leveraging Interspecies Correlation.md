- ## Main Contributions
	- Introduced the **elite hypervolume** concept and propose two metrics to characterize it: the **genotypic spread** and the **genotypic similarity**.
	- Introduced a new variation operator, called "directional variation".
- All the elites of the search space, as found by [[MAP-Elites]], are likely to be concentrated in a sub-part of the genotypic space.
- For any group of high-performing solutions, even if they diversify in behavior, they
