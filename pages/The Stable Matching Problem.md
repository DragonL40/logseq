- Given as input
	- $n$ men and $n$ women
	- $M = {m_1, \dots, m_n}, W = {w_1, \dots, w_n}$
	- For each $w \in W$, given a "preference list" (aka. "ranking") of the men.
		- an array of length $n$ listing all the men in decreasing order of preference.
	- Similarly, each men has a "preference list" for all the women.
- Mathematical/Economic Question: Does a [[Stable Matching]] exist for every set of preference list?
- Algorithmic Question: Can a [[Stable Matching]] be computed efficiently?
	- In this class, efficiently means low order polynomial time.
