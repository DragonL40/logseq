- The most structurally complex molecules known...
	- Vary extensively in structure, enabling their diverse functions
	- each protein has a unique three-dimensional shape.
- proteins are constructed from amino acids.
- nearly every dynamic function of a living being depends on proteins

	- Enzymatic proteins
		- Selective acceleration of chemical reactions
		- Example: Digestive enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of bonds in food molecules
	- Denfensive proteins
		- Protection against disease
		- Example: Antibodies inactivate and help destroy viruses and bacteria
	- Storage proteins
		- Storage of amino acids
		- Example: Casein, the protein of milk, is the major source of amino acids for baby mammals.
		- Example: Plants have storage proteins in their seeds.
		- Example: Ovalbumin is the protein of egg white, used as a n amino acid source for the developing embryo.
