- The most structurally complex molecules known...
	- Vary extensively in structure, enabling their diverse functions
	- each protein has a unique three-dimensional shape.
- proteins are constructed from amino acids.
- nearly every dynamic function of a living being depends on proteins

	- Enzymatic proteins
		- Selective acceleration of chemical reactions
		- Example: Digestive enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of bonds in food molecules
	- Denfensive proteins
		- Protection against disease
		- Example: Antibodies inactivate and help destroy viruses and bacteria
	- Storage proteins
		- Storage of amino acids
		- Example: Casein, the protein of milk, is the major source of amino acids for baby mammals.
		- Example: Plants have storage proteins in their seeds.
		- Example: Ovalbumin is the protein of egg white, used as a n amino acid source for the developing embryo.
	- Transport proteins
		- Transport of substances
		- Example: Hemoglobin, the iron-containing protein of vertebrate blood, transport oxygen from the lungs to other parts of the body.
	- Hormonal proteins
		- Coordination of an organism's activities
		- Example: Insulin, a hormone secreted by the pancreas, causes other tissues to take up glucose, thus regulating blood sugar concentration.
	- Receptor proteins
		- Response of cell to chemical stimuli
		- Example: Receptors built into the membrane of a nerve cell detect signaling molecules released by other nerve cells.
	- Contractile and motor proteins
		- Movement
		- Example: Motor proteins are responsible for the undulations of cilia and flagella.
		- Actin and myosin proteins are responsible for the contraction of muscles.
	- Structural proteins
		- Support
		- Keratin is the protein of hair, horns, feathers, and other skin appendages.
		- Insects and spiders use silk fibers to make their cocoons and webs, respectively.
		- Collagen and elastin proteins provide a fibrous framework in animal connective tissues.
