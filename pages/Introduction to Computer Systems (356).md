## [[2's Complement]] System
- How does 2's Complement System represent numbers?
	- Normal binary place values except MSB has negative weight
- How to extend [[2's complement]]? (Sign Extension)
	- For positive numbers, add leading zeros
	- For negative numbers, add leading ones
- How to truncate [[2's complement]]? (Sign Truncation)
  collapsed:: true
	- Remove copies of sign bit
	-
	  $$[00]011010 = 011010 \\ 11110011 = 10011$$
- How to take the [[2's Complement]] of a number?
- How to add in [[2's complement]] ?
- How to subtract in [[2's complement]]?
- How to detect overflow?
	- If **positive + positive = negative** or **negative + negative = positive**
- What is the difference between [[logical shift]] and [[arithmetic shift]]?
- How to multiply/divide by power of 2?
	- Left shift = multiply by power of 2
	- Right shift = divide by power of 2
- What if I need to multiply a number by a non-power of 2?
	- $17x = 16x + 1x$
- When does dividing by $2^k$ with `x >> k` works and doesn't work?
	- Works if $x \ge 0$ OR ($x <0$ AND $x$ is a multiple of $2^k$)
	- Doesn't work if $x < 0$ AND $x$ is NOT a multiple of $2^k$
- How to compensate for the extra 0.5 when rounding a negative number in the [[2's complement]] system? (Biasing)
	- Add $2^k-1$, the sequence of $k$ ones, to $x$ before shifting.
- Why use floating point value?
	- It can be used to represent very small numbers and very large numbers.
- How does floating point numbers represent more range than int with the same amount of bits (32/64)?
	- It uses a digit to represent the exponent
	- We subtract a bias number of 4 from the exponent to convert the range of [0,9] to []
- What is a fixed point number?
	- the position of the decimal point is fixed (presumed)
