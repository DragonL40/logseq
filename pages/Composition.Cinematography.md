## [[Framing]]
	- Framing is the visual structure enclosing the action.
	- Most common aspect ratios:
		- Classical Framing - 1.33:1 (4:3) - the Edition/Lumiere ratio
		- Widescreen Framing - 1.85:1 (5.5:3) - standard since 1950s, close to HD television
		- Anamorphic/Cinemascope/Panavision - 2.35:1 (7.05x3, 21:9)
	- Aesthetic Considerations
		- Center of interest is usually the center of the frame, 1/3 from the top.
		- Filmmakers will offset the action in the frame
			- Decentering vs. centering
			- Top-loading (oppressive) vs. bottom-loading (uplifting)
			- The edge is uneasy
			- Oblique frames - off balance, unreliable
		- Framing can separate or call attention
			- Fragmentation of the frame - objects or light split the frame, or you can have a truly split screen
			- Matting/Masking - frames take different shapes
			- Frames within frams
		- Classical rule of framing - show what is essential
	- Off-Screen Space
		- We feel that the world continues beyond the frame, unlike theater
		- Six zones of off-screen space - right, left, above, below, in front (behind the camera), and behind the set
## [[Staging]]
	- [[proxemic patterns]] - the arrangement of objects and players in relation to each other within the frame.
		- [[proxemic patterns]] with in the frame
			- The spatial relationships among the elements in the frame
			- i.e. placing two actors right next to each other in the frame versus far apart.
			- The second type of proxemic patterns (outside the frame) is part of photography - how the lens and the camera shape the space
	- Lines and Planes
		- Lines
			- Horizontals = calm, flowing
			- Verticals = Dominant, energetic, erect
			- Diagonals = dynamic, unstable, in motion
			- Jagged = chaos, conflict, danger
		- Planes
			- One plane is flat
			- Multiple planes create depth, open up space
	- Movement
		- Movement is more interesting than stasis
		- Moving right to left is stronger than left to right because it opposes the natural parsing direction for writing
		- Moving toward the audience is stronger than moving away
