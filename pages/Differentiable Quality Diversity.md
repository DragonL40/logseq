- Previous [[Quality Diversity]] algorithms ignores gradient information of the objective and the measure function.
- The differentiable quality diversity problem is a special case of [[Quality Diversity]] where both the objective and measure functions are first-order differentiable.
- ## Main Contribution
	- Introduce and formalize the problem of [[DQD]].
	- Present the algorithm [[Objective and Measure Gradient MAP-Elites via a Gradient Arborescence]], a [[DQD]] algorithm that leverages gradient information to efficiently explore the joint range of the objective and measure functions.
