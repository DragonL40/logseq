- Given $A, B, C$ with $|A| = |B| = |C| = n$
  Given collection $X \subseteq A \times B \times C$ of triples (this is the hyper-edges).
  Is there a subset $T \subseteq X$ that forms a perfect 3-Dimensional matching? (For each $e \in A \cup B \cup C$, exactly one triple $t \in T$ contains $e$)
- Simultaneously a packing and covering problem.
	- Can we pack $n$ disjoint triples?
