- ## Ray Traversal
	- How to sample the **volume ray**?
	- Method 1: Regular Sampling
		- Simply sample the points at a fixed interval along the ray (requires interpolation for a lot of the points that doesn't lie on the edges of the voxel).
	- Method 2: Scan Conversion
		- Take the center of each voxel that the ray traverses.
	- Method 3: Voxel Intersection
		- Samples the volume of all of the voxel intersections.
