- ## Summary
	- This paper proposes a new [[quality diversity]] algorithm that bridges the gap between single-objective optimization and [[quality diversity]] optimization.
## Main Contributions
	- Propose a new algorithm, [[CMA-MAE]] that smoothly blends between [[CMA-ES]] and [[CMA-ME]] through a single parameter $\alpha$.
