### How to take control of your schedule
	- Overaching rules when the author is using her calendar:
		- **Everthing goes in there.**
		- **Make time for the things that matter, not the other way around**
			- Take a few minutes at the beginning of the week to ensure that you have time for the few key goals you are working towards.
		- **It's okay to say no**
			- If something is not important and not related to your goals, say "no" or delay it to a few weeks later.
		- **Be flexible with your scheduled tasks**
			- If something took longer than expected and you weren't able to go to the gym. Do other exercises, like 15 minutes running block, instead.
### 5 time management techniques
	- 1. **Get enough sleep**
		- [Research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8167721_Sleep_Quality_Sleep_Propensity_and_Academic_Performance) shows that being sleep deprived negatively affects your performance.
		- It is harder to focus and harder to switch between tasks when you're tired.
	- 2. **Plan ahead**
		- While planning may not impact how well you perform, [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5718186/) found that it does impact your ability to actually execute.
		- If you take the time to plan and commit to doing certain things, you are more likely to do them.
	- 3. **Avoid multitasking**
		- Constantly switching between tasks has a terrible effect on attention.
		- Remove distractions by putting your phone in another room and turning off notifications on your laptop
	- 4. **Create mindful routines**
		- Think about the times of the day where you feel more productive, and take advantage of it.
	- 5. **Take breaks**
		- Spend some times alone, go take a walk, meditate, or whatever, as long as it involves getting away from your laptop and your phone.
		- __Add these breaks to your calendar!__
