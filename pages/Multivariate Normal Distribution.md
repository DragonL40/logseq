- Normal distribution for higher dimensions.
- A multivariate normal distribution, $N(m, C)$, has a unimodel, "bell-shaped" density, where the top of the bell (the modal value) corresponds to the distribution mean, $m$. The distribution $N(m, C)$ is uniquely determined by its mean $m \in \R^n$ and its symmetric and [[Positive Definite Matrix]]
