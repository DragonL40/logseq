- substitutions or insertions or deletions of single nucleotide pair (point mutations); or of more than one nucleotide pair
- Example: ((613f1259-b6e2-4dd1-ab8a-ef4101208d6a))
- **Missense** point mutations result in the formation of a completely difference amino acid.
- **Silent** point mutations still results in the production of the same protein.
- **Nonsense** point mutations codes for a stop codon.
- Point mutations can also lead to [[frameshift]] (subsequent codon triplets shifted and all wrong)
