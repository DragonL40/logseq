- substitutions or insertions or deletions of single nucleotide pair (point mutations); or of more than one nucleotide pair
- Example: ((613f1259-b6e2-4dd1-ab8a-ef4101208d6a))
- You can get **silent** mutations when the change in genetic code does not change the prospective enzyme.
- You can get **nonsense** mutations where it leads to wild changes.
- Point mutations can also lead to [[frameshift]] (subsequent codon triplets shifted and all wrong)
