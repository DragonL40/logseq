- Start with `.` (e.g. `.text`, `.quad`, `.long`)
- Similar to pre-processor statements (`#include`, `#define`, etc.) and global variable declarations in C/C++
	- Text and data segments
	- Reserving & initializing global variables and constants
	- Compiler and linker status
- Directs the assembler in how to assemble the actual instructions and how to initialize memory when the program is loaded.
- Directives specify:
	- where to place the information
	- what names are visible to other files in the program
	- global data variables & their size
	- alignment requirements
- **Text and Data Segments**
	- `.text` directive indicates the following instructions should be placed in the program area of memory
	- `.data` directive indicates the following data declarations will be placed in the data memory segment
