- ## Main Contributions:
	- formalize the problem of quality diversity for reinforcement learning (QD-RL) and
	  reduce it to an instance of DQD.
	- develop two QD-RL variants of the DQD algorithm [[CMA-MEGA]], where each algorithm approximates objective and measure gradients with a different combination of ES and actor-critic methods.
	- benchmark our variants on four PyBullet locomotion tasks from QDGym.
