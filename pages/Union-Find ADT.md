- Give [[Kruskal's Algorithm]] a significant improvement in runtime.
- Supports collection of disjoint sets.
	- `Find(v)`, which returns the name of the set containing node $v$ is in. If `Find(u) == Find(v)`, then `v` and `u` are in the same set/component, and we don't want to add edge $\langle u, v \rangle$.
	- `Union(u,v)`, which combines the components of node $u$ and node $v$ into the same component. We use this when we add edge $\langle u, v \rangle$.
- Our implementation:
	- Directed forest. Root of a node is the "representative"
		- `Find(v)`: Follow pointers from $v$ to parent, until there are no more parents.
		- `Union(u, v)`: Make one of the roots of $u, v$ parent of the other.
			- To avoid creating a linked-list, always point the root of smaller tree (less nodes) to the larger tree (more nodes). Then, the height above a node can only increase when the

  collapsed:: true
	- Sorting takes $\Theta(m \log m)$
	- `Find` is called $2m$ times
	- `Union` is called $n-1$ times, because there is at most $n-1$ edges on the graph
	- Runtime $= \Theta(m \log m + m \cdot Find + n \cdot Union)$
## Implementing Union-Find
	- Every node points to a "parent" node that is in the same component.
	- The root of the component has no parent, and is the "captain", or "identifier", of the component.
	- Runtime
		- `Union(u,v)` will be $\Theta(1)$, since we just assign the parent pointer.
		- `Find(v)` will potentially be $\Theta(n)$, if the parent pointers form a linked list.
	- How could we modify Union to ensure the runtime of Find is minimized
		- Always point the smaller-depth tree to the larger depth tree.
		- By doing this, we reduce the runtime of Find to $\Theta(\log n)$
