  > There will be $n$ requests labeled $1, \dots, n$, with each request $i$ specifying a start time $s_i$ and a finish time $f_i$. Naturally, we have $s_i < f_i$ for all $i$. Two requests $i$ and $j$ are _compatible_ if the requested intervals do not overlap. **The goal is to select a compatible subset of requests of maximum possible size.**
