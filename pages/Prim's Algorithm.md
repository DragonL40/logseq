- What is the [[Cut Property]]?
## The Algorithm
- $T = \phi$
- $S = \{s\}$ for arbitrary $s \in V$
- While $S \ne V$
	- Let $e = <u,v>$ be the min cost edge with $u \in S$ and $v \notin S$
	- Add $e$ to $T$
	- Add $v$ to $S$
-
- #[[Proof by Induction]] _Prim's Algorithm produces a [[Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)]] of G_ (feasibility)
	- I.H.: After iteration $i$, $|S| = i+1$ and $(S,T)$ is a tree.
	- B.C.: True for $i = 0$
	- I.S.: In each iteration, we add one node $v$ to $S$, plus $e$ from $T$ to $v$
		- After $n-1$ iterations, $|S| = n \implies S = V$
		- $(V,T)$ is a tree
		- Therefore, $T$ is a Spanning Tree of $G$.
- _Need to show that output tree T minimizes cost_ (optimality)
	- Let $T^*$ be a MST
	- Each time an edge $e$ is added by Prim's, $e$ was the min-cost edge crossing $(S, V-S)$ for $S$ in that iteration
	- By [[Cut Property]], $e \in T$ must be in every MST, in particular in $T^*$
	- $T \subseteq T^*$
	- $c(T) \subseteq c(T^*)$
- _The runtime of the Prim's Algorithm is_ $n\log n$
	- Same as the proof for [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]].
	- This is because Prim's  just uses a different key as Dijkstra's.
