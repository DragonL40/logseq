title:: BARF: Bundle-Adjusting Neural Radiance Fields
alias:: BARF

- A hard prerequisite of [[NeRF]] and other view synthesis methods is accurate camera poses of the given images, which is typically obtained through auxiliary off-the-shelf algorithms.
- ## Major Contributions
	- Establish a theoretical connection between classical image alighment to joint registration and reconstruction with [[NeRF]].
