- Consider again a situation in which we have a single resource and a set of n requests to use the resource for an interval of time. Assume that the resource is available starting at time s. In contrast to the previous problem, however, each request is now more flexible. Instead of a start time and finish time, the request i has a deadline di, and it requires a contiguous time interval of length ti, but it is willing to be scheduled at any time before the deadline. Each accepted request must be assigned an interval of time of length ti, and different requests must be assigned nonoverlapping intervals.

  > There exists an optimal schedule with no "idle time"

  > Schedules with no idle time are in one-to-one correspondence with orderings of jobs
