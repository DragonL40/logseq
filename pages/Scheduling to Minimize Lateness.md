  > Consider again a situation in which we have a single resource and a set of $n$ requests to use the resource for an interval of time. Assume that the resource is available starting at time $s$. In contrast to the previous problem, however, each request is now more flexible. Instead of a start time and finish time, the request i has a deadline $d_i$, and it requires a contiguous time interval of length $t_i$, but it is willing to be scheduled at any time before the deadline. Each accepted request must be assigned an interval of time of length $t_i$, and different requests must be assigned non-overlapping intervals.
