- ### Background
	- Recent development uses a single, uncalibrated smartphone photo of the sample to reverse-engineer the individual components of its [[SVBRDF]]. This method requires the photo to be taken with a flash
	- **This approach falls short in outdoor scenarios.**
		- Camera flash may have no effect, with lighting being dominated by the sky and/or the sun.
- ## Main Contributions
	- A single image method to address outdoor material capture scenarios.
