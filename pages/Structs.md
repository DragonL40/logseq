- Structs are just **collections of heterogeneous data**
- Each member is laid out in consecutive memory locations, with some **padding inserted to ensure alignment**
	- Intel machinies don't require alignment but perform better when it is used
	- Reordering can reduce size!
	- **"Each type aligned at a multiple of its size"**
- Its start/end should have the **largest alignment** required by its members
