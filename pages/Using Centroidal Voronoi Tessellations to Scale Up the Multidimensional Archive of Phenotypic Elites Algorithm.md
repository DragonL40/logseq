- ## Main Contributions
	- introduce a new algorithm called [[CVT-MAP-Elites]] and demonstrate its advantage over [[MAP-Elites]] in a maze navigation task and the simulated hexapod locomotion task
	- propose a new methodology for assessing the quality of the archives produced by [[illumination algorithms]]
- ## Key Concepts
	- [[Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations]]
		- A [[Voronoi Tessellation]] is a partitioning of a space into geometric regions based on distance to $k$ prespecified points which are often called _sites_.
