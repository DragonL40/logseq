- [[Kruskal's Algorithm]] adds edges from smallest to largest value, unless adding an edge creates a cycle. It provably find the [[Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)]].
	- Sort the edges in increasing order of cost
	- $T=\phi$
	- For $e \in E$ in order
		- If $T + e$ is acyclic, then add $e$ to $T$
	- Endfor
	- Output $T$

- The runtime of Kruskal's was $\Theta(m \log m + m \cdot Find + n \cdot Union)$, which now simplifies to $\Theta(m \log m)$.
