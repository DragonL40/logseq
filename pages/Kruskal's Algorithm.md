- [[Kruskal's Algorithm]] adds edges from smallest to largest value, unless adding an edge creates a cycle. It provably find the [[Minimum Spanning Tree]].
- [[Kruskal's Algorithm]] Runtime
	- The runtime of Kruskal's was $\Theta(m \log m + m \cdot Find + n \cdot Union)$, which now simplifies to $\Theta(m \log m)$.
