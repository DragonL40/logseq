- [[Kruskal's Algorithm]] adds edges from smallest to largest value, unless adding an edge creates a cycle.
	- Sort the edges in increasing order of cost
	- $T=\phi$
	- For $e \in E$ in order
		- If $T + e$ is acyclic, then add $e$ to $T$
	- Endfor
	- Output $T$

- _Kruskal's Algorithm produces a [[Spanning Tree]] of G_ (feasibility)
	- Let $T$ be output of algorithm
	- $T$ is acyclic by definition of algorithm
	- If we show that $T$ is connected, then by ((613fd6c8-6437-42e4-9e61-9aba48332d96)) we know that $T$ is a spanning tree.
	- We know that $G$ is connected
	- Take an edge $e$ in $G$,
		- If $e \notin T$, that means adding $e$ would have created a cycle in $T$. In other words, there is a path $p_e$ in $T$ between endpoints of $e$ that does not include $e$.
		- If $e \in T$, then there is a path in $T$ between endpoints of $e$.
	- Take two nodes $(u,v)$, we know $\exists$ path from $u$ to $v$ in $G$, by replacing edges $e$ not in $T$ with $p_e$.
	- $\exists$ a path from $u$ to $v$ in $T$. $_\square$
- _Kruskal's Algorithm produces a [[Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)]] of G_ (optimality)
	- Enough to show that each edge we add satisfies [[Cut Property]].
	- Consider edge $e = (u,v)$ added in iteration $i$
	- **Notation**: $T_i$ is $T$ at beginning of iteration $i$
	- Let $S$ be [[connected component]] of $u$ in $(v, T_i)$
	- $v \notin S$
	- We need to show that $e$ is the min-cost edge crossing $(S, V-S)$
		- Suppose for contradiction $e' = (u', v')$ is cheaper and crosses $(S, V-S)$
		- $e'$ was examined in earlier iteration $j < i$ and was not added
		- $T_i + e'$ is acyclic $\implies$ $T_j + e'$ is acyclic (becasue $T_j \le T_i$)
		- Therefore, the algorithm should have added $e'$ already.
		- Contradiction, since we claimed that $e'$ crosses $(S, V-S)$ which is not possible if we

- The runtime of Kruskal's was $\Theta(m \log m + m \cdot Find + n \cdot Union)$, which now simplifies to $\Theta(m \log m)$.
