- [[Kruskal's Algorithm]] adds edges from smallest to largest value, unless adding an edge creates a cycle.
	- Sort the edges in increasing order of cost
	- $T=\phi$
	- For $e \in E$ in order
		- If $T + e$ is acyclic, then add $e$ to $T$
	- Endfor
	- Output $T$
-
- Kruskal's Algorithm produces a [[Spanning Tree]] of G (feasibility)
	- Let $T$ be output of algorithm
	- $T$ is acyclic by definition of algorithm
	- We know that $G$ is connected
	- By ((613fd6c8-6437-42e4-9e61-9aba48332d96))

- The runtime of Kruskal's was $\Theta(m \log m + m \cdot Find + n \cdot Union)$, which now simplifies to $\Theta(m \log m)$.
